Long times have gone since the days of moral and psychological calm . What we need right now is a radical change, someone who can quickly solve these problems of uncertainity in us. There is a chaos, a swirl inside us . Maybe he could be a shrink that may talk us out of our misery . Everywhere I see, people are sad and the anger they have on themselves seeps out to other people and they behave badly because of that. Every word they say is a reflection of what they think of themselves .
