NOTE ON ACCENT, PRONUNCIATION, INFLEXION, AND 

FOREIGN WORDS 

ACCENT 

Accent is marked by the turned period ("), which is normally placed after the 
accented vowel or diphthong (a'etop, allow, a'ccent noun, acce'nt verb, exag- 
gepa'tion, exa*g , g , epatop) ; two equal accents in one word are both marked (ti*tbi*t) ; 
and the ■ is used for the secondary as well as for the main accent in long words where 
the former might be doubtful (cir'eumgypa'te, a*biogene*tieally). 

But the place of the turned period in syllables whose vowel sound is modified by r or 
re is after the whole combination (por'ter, pupe'ly), any possible confusion being 
guarded against by the - or ^ (mere'ly, but hepe'tieal). Similarly it stands after 
silent consonants (migh'ty, deb'top, blaek'guard), consonants that merely modify 
a vowel sound (eal'mness), or e mute following the accented vowel (blue'bell). 

Some miscellaneous examples are added :— fo'rest, fore'noon, for'tnight, fore'nsic ; 
bar'ring, ba Track; bal'my, ba'lsam ; arraig'n ; demes'ne ; sig'ning, si'gnature; high'er; 
Cadme'an; defray; bye'-law; da"ffadowndi*lly ; ca'noniza'tion. 

PRONUNCIATION 

When necessary, a bracket is placed immediately after a word, with directions for 
pronouncing it or some part of it. In these brackets, 

(1) Vowel sounds have the value shown by the roman-type letters in :— mate, mete, 
viite, mote, mute, moot ; rack, reck, rick, rock, ruck, rook ; caw, cow ; bah, boil. 

(2) Vowel-combinations with r (the r is not trilled before a consonant or mute e) are 
as follows :— 

wiare, mere, mire, move, demure, moor ; dowry ; part, pert, port. 

(3) Italicized vowels or vowel-combinations have the indistinct sound shown in 
again, moment, admiral, morose, support, certain, connoisseur, comfort, jealous, murder. 

(4) Each consonant or consonant-combination has only one sound; the value of 
ambiguous or specially used ones is :— 

eh as in loch ; dh as iwdhen ( = then) ; g" as in get ; jasin./e£; x\g a.sin singer ; ngg 
anin finger ; n-g" as in un-gardid (=unguarded) ; p as in rat (and see vowel-combina- 
tions above) ; s as in sister ; th as in thinketh ; tsh as in tship (=chip) ; w as in wit (and 
see vowel sounds above) ; y as in yet ; zh as in fuzhn (=fusion). 

Letters marked - or w# in the word itself have the same value as in the brackets, 
except that e is also used, when there is no danger of confusion, to show that e is not 
mute or part of a compound sound ; so ni"cety, ca'ffeine. 

INFLEXION 

The rules assumed, exceptions to which are noted in a bracket placed after a word's 
grammatical description, are as follows :— 

1. Verbs add -s in 3rd sing, pres., -ed in past and p.p., -ing in pres. part., -er to form 
agent-noun. 

2. Verbs and adjectives drop final mute e before -ing, -ed, -er, -est. 

3. Before -ed, -ing, -er, -est, -eth, monosyllabic verbs and adjectives double a final 
single consonant (except x) if preceded by a single vowel. 

4. (a) nouns, (b) adjectives, (c) verbs, in -y preceded by a consonant have (a) plural 
-ies, (b) comparative -ier, superlative -iest, adverb -ily, noun -iness, (c) 3rd sing. pres. 
-ies, past and p.p. -ied, agent-noun -ier. 

5. Nouns in -s, -x, -z, -ch = tsh, and -sh, and some in -o, form plural by adding -es ; 
others add -s. 

6. Monosyllabic adjectives and disyllables in -y compare in -er, -est ; others with 
more, most. 

FOREIGN WORDS 

Words usually or often printed in italics as either incompletely naturalized or com- 
pletely foreign are in sloping type. When either the word itself or any of its sounds 
is distinctly un-English, the reader is warned by a bracket containing, instead of pro- 
nunciation, the letter or letters standing for the language it belongs to. Otherwise, 
pronunciation is given for sloped words to the same extent as for others, but is often 
to be taken as merely approximate.
