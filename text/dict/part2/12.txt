fallacy. (2) n. of state or quality f. L -ati-a f. 
nouns in -at- (nom. -as, -i- being part of stem 
or connecting link) : med. L primat- primati-a 
primacy ; and by analogy supremacy. (3) n. of 
state f. med. L -ati-a f. nouns in -atus : ad- 
vocat-us advocat-ia advocacy ; and by analogy 
curacy. This formation was extended to adjj. 
f. L -atus to form accuracy, obstinacy, from 
accurate, obstinate, where L has nouns in -atio ; 
hence other L words in -atio appear in E with 
â– acy where E has no corresponding adj. in -ate, 
as conspiracy; similarly, E -acy for L -atus 
(n. of 4th decl.), as magistr-atus magistracy, 
gives rise to episcopacy as if f. E episcopate ;

m v, it was unchanged. In OF, L ad, wherever 
recognized as such, became a-, even before 
vowels, as aorner f. L adornare ; but later 
the spelling was Latinized, sometimes with 
changed pronunciation, both in F and still 
more in E, where the OF forms had been 
adopted. (The use of ad-, ab-, in pairs like 
adoral, aboral, situated at and aicay from 
mouth, is unknown to L.) (2) The pedantic 
spelling ad- for a- was sometimes extended to 
a- coming not from L ad- but f. L ab- (advance 
F. avancer L ab-anteare), f. OF en- (addebted 
OF endeM), f. OF es- f. L ex- (affray OF es- 
frayer), f. OE a- (accurse ME a-curse), &amp;c; so 
admiral f. Arab, amiral. New native com- 
pounds with E a- were falsely spelt in the same 
way.
